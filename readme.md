# First
### control the amount of stack tracing shown
### add nice toasters to acknowledge activities performed (crud)

# Second
### See how this works not in dev environment? especially with live form creation. put assets outside of jar?
### Add each forms configuration as JSON into the db so that we can recreate the latest templated file on startup instead of just recreating the file
### Add additional components
### Add delete menu which deletes asset from file and orders and menu from db

# Third 
### use mustache template for listings
### replace js with backbone

# Fourth 
### add multi nested json payload available
### make the generated forms behave like google forms

# Fifth
### add validation / cross validation to form
### add jms bundle to do event triggered database changes
